  !> Mesh type, from the nodes of every block.
  !>  - ndir is the number of index directions with more than one cell: 3 if a block has more than one cell in k,
  !>    otherwise 2 if a block has more than one cell in j, otherwise 1.
  !>  - delthe is the angle of the axisymmetric wedge of a 2-D mesh, or of the sectors closed by the rotational
  !>    periodicity (type 200 on faces 5 and 6) of a 3-D mesh, and 0 otherwise. A 2-D mesh is a wedge when, in every
  !>    block, the k = 1 node plane is the k = 0 plane turned about the x axis by the same angle; it is plane when no
  !>    block is so turned. In 3-D the k = dim(3) node plane of every block with a type-200 face is the k = 0 plane turned
  !>    about the x axis by the same angle, or translated (delthe = 0). Every node is checked (Node_Planes); blocks that
  !>    disagree stop the run.
  !>  - The angle is the azimuth turned by the node (0,1) of the block, as it always was, or by the node farthest from
  !>    the axis when that one lies on it. The angles of two blocks agree when they differ by at most ETA of the angle.
  !>  - The checks are relative to the move of the nodes per cell in k, the largest move of a node from one plane to the
  !>    other over the cells between them (the thickness of a 2-D block), not to the size of the coordinates: the
  !>    coordinates of a mesh are written with a finite number of digits, and their round-off, relative to that move, is
  !>    what a turn or a translation leaves over. A check relative to the size of the coordinates, at 1e-6 of it, fails a
  !>    wedge of 5 degrees written with 5 significant digits, which is then taken for a plane mesh, and passes a plane slab
  !>    far from the x axis, which is then taken for a wedge. A 2-D block nearer a turn than a translation, or nearer a
  !>    translation than a turn, but not to within ETA of its thickness, stops the run: its nodes are written with too
  !>    few digits to tell its type, or its k planes are neither parallel nor turned about the x axis.
