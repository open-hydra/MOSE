  !> .true. for NaN and infinities, the values with all the exponent bits set. The test reads the bits:
  !> -ffast-math (-ffinite-math-only), an option of the RELEASE build, lets gfortran fold isnan, ieee_is_nan and
  !> ieee_is_finite to constants. Reading the bits is an operation on integers, which raises no floating-point
  !> exception, and it is no comparison, which a NaN passes as false: the state update (Lib_Newstate) and the readers of
  !> the input values (the initial condition in Wrap_Setup, the time tables in Series_Data_m, the lines of bc.txt in
  !> IO_BC, the Q2D files of type 410 in IO_BC_Q2D, the reals of input.ini in the registry, the axis and the origin of
  !> the rotating frame, the time and the counters of a restart in IO_Solution) check their values with it, also in a
  !> build that traps the invalid operations, such as the DEBUG build.
